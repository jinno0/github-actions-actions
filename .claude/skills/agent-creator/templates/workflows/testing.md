# Testing Workflow

For test automation and quality assurance:

1. **Test Planning**
   - Analyze requirements and test scope
   - Identify test types needed (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Plan test data and environments
   - Define success criteria

2. **Test Execution**
   - Run unit tests with coverage requirements (80%+)
   - Execute integration and API tests
   - Perform end-to-end testing
   - Run security and performance tests

3. **Test Analysis**
   - Analyze test results and coverage reports
   - Identify failing tests and root causes
   - Assess test quality and effectiveness
   - Recommend test improvements

4. **Quality Validation**
   - Verify code quality standards
   - Check security vulnerabilities
   - Validate performance benchmarks
   - Ensure documentation completeness

5. **Reporting**
   - Generate comprehensive test reports
   - Provide quality recommendations
   - Identify areas needing improvement
   - Document test automation status
