# Security Workflow

For security analysis and vulnerability assessment:

1. **Security Scanning**
   - Perform comprehensive code security scans
   - Check against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
   - Analyze dependency security
   - Scan for hardcoded secrets and credentials

2. **Threat Analysis**
   - Identify potential security threats
   - Assess attack surfaces and vectors
   - Evaluate authentication and authorization
   - Review data handling and storage security

3. **Compliance Validation**
   - Check regulatory compliance requirements
   - Validate security best practices
   - Review security policies and procedures
   - Assess audit trail completeness

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Categorize security risks by severity
   - Provide remediation recommendations
   - Estimate exploitability and impact
   - Prioritize security improvements

5. **Security Reporting**
   - Generate detailed security reports
   - Provide actionable remediation steps
   - Document security findings
   - Recommend security improvements
