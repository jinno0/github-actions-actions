# UX Design Cleanup Report

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Task:** ux_design_cleanup
**Target Repository:** github-actions-actions
**Analyst:** AI Hub System

---

## Executive Summary

The UX design cleanup task has been completed. **No cleanup actions were required** as the repository already maintains a clean, minimal structure for UX design artifacts.

---

## Target Directory Analysis

### Expected vs. Actual Structure

| Aspect | Expected (Instruction) | Actual (Repository) | Status |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Directory** | `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/` | `.bmad/ux-design/` | ⚠️ Different path |
| **Primary File** | `ux-design-specification.md` | `ux-design-document.md` | ⚠️ Different name |
| **HTML Files** | `ux-color-themes.html`, `ux-design-directions.html` | None | ℹ️ Not generated yet |

### Investigation Findings

1. **Directory Structure Discrepancy:**
   - The instruction references `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/` (workflow output directory)
   - The actual repository uses `.bmad/ux-design/` (static storage directory)
   - `_bmad-output/` directory does not exist in the repository

2. **File Status:**
   - ✅ **Single UX design document exists:** `.bmad/ux-design/ux-design-document.md` (22,755 bytes, 931 lines)
   - ✅ **No duplicate files found**
   - ✅ **No placeholder artifacts:** No `{{`, `TBD`, `TODO`, or `PLACEHOLDER` markers detected
   - ℹ️ **No HTML outputs:** HTML files are generated by the `create-ux-design` workflow but haven't been created yet

3. **Document Quality:**
   - Well-structured, comprehensive UX documentation
   - Contains: UX philosophy, user journeys, design patterns, and actionable specifications
   - Document version: 1.0 (2026-01-26)
   - Status: Retrospective UX Documentation (Phase 3 - Stabilization & Adoption)

---

## Cleanup Actions Taken

### ✅ No Actions Required

The repository already meets the cleanup goals:

1. **Single Source of Truth:** Only one UX design document exists
2. **No Duplicates:** No redundant or obsolete UX files
3. **No Placeholders:** Document is complete and well-formed
4. **Minimal Structure:** Clean directory organization within `.bmad/ux-design/`

## Current File Inventory

### UX Design Files (All Repository)

| File Path | Size | Type | Status |
|-----------|------|------|--------|
| `.bmad/ux-design/ux-design-document.md` | 22.3 KB | Markdown | ✅ Active |
| `.claude/commands/bmad/bmm/workflows/create-ux-design.md` | 0.2 KB | Command | ✅ Active (workflow definition) |

### Other BMAD Artifacts (For Context)

| Directory | Files | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `.bmad/architecture/` | 1 file | Architecture decision records |
| `.bmad/prd/` | 1 file | Product requirements |
| `.bmad/epics/` | 1 file | Epic definitions |
| `.bmad/stories/` | 3 files | User story implementations |

---

## Verification Results

### ✅ Minimal Structure Confirmed

```bash
# Single UX design document
$ ls -1 .bmad/ux-design/
ux-design-document.md

# No duplicates
$ find . -name "*ux-design*.md" ! -path "./.git/*" | wc -l
2 (1 document + 1 workflow command)

# No HTML files (not yet generated)
$ find . -name "*.html" ! -path "./.git/*" | wc -l
0

# No placeholders
$ rg -c "{{|TBD|TODO|PLACEHOLDER" .bmad/ux-design/ux-design-document.md
0
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Directory Path Clarification

**Issue:** Instruction references `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/` which doesn't exist.

**Options:**
- **A)** Update instruction to use `.bmad/ux-design/` as the target directory
- **B)** Create `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/` as the workflow output location (if workflow generates artifacts)
- **C)** Keep current structure and clarify that cleanup is for static storage only

**Recommendation:** Option B - Separate static storage (`.bmad/ux-design/`) from workflow output (`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/`)

### 2. File Naming Consistency

**Issue:** Instruction expects `ux-design-specification.md` but actual file is `ux-design-document.md`.

**Recommendation:** Consider standardizing on one naming convention. Current name (`ux-design-document.md`) is clear and functional.

### 3. HTML Output Generation

**Observation:** The `create-ux-design` workflow may generate HTML artifacts (`ux-color-themes.html`, `ux-design-directions.html`) but these don't exist yet.

**Recommendation:** If workflow is run, ensure HTML outputs are written to `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/` to separate generated artifacts from static documentation.

---

## Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - No cleanup required

The repository maintains a clean, minimal UX design structure with:
- Single source of truth (`.bmad/ux-design/ux-design-document.md`)
- No duplicate or obsolete files
- No placeholder content requiring cleanup
- Clear organization within `.bmad/` directory

The cleanup instruction's targets (`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/`) represent a future state where workflow-generated HTML artifacts would be stored. Since the workflow hasn't been executed yet, no cleanup was necessary.
