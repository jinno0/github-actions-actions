  # No PRs to apply in this run - focusing on verification and feedback

execution_strategy:
  approach: "Verification and planning cycle"
  rationale:
    - "At retention policy limit (3 runs)"
    - "Main remaining PR (PR-006) is large effort"
    - "Previous run (PR-007, PR-008) just completed successfully"
    - "Optimal time to capture baseline and plan next implementation cycle"

    description: "Dry Run verification implementation for remaining 10 Actions"
    estimated_effort: "2-3 hours"
    success_criteria:
      - "All 13 Actions support Dry Run mode"
      - "pytest tests/ -k dry_run passes"
      - "CF-004 verification status: failed → passed"

    estimated_effort: "30-60 minutes"
    prerequisites:
      - "Claude CLI installed and configured"
      - "GitHub token with repo permissions"

  priority_3:
