title: "Address YAML Line Length Warnings (ISS-NEW-002)"
status: "deferred"
deferred_at: "2026-02-08T01:55:00Z"
reason: |
  Low-priority style improvement. These are warnings, not errors, and don't block CI.
  The instruction emphasizes minimal, focused changes. PR-005 would require 1-2 hours
  for cosmetic improvements with minimal functional benefit.

current_state:
  warnings_before: 18
  warnings_after: 9
  warnings_remaining: 9
  files_affected:
    - "actions/action-fixer/action.yml" (3 warnings)
    - "actions/auto-rebase/action.yml" (1 warning)

    - "actions/release-notes-ai/action.yml" (2 warnings)
    - "actions/spec-to-code/action.yml" (2 warnings)

recommendation: |
  Defer to maintenance cycle or address incrementally during natural code reviews.
  Consider adjusting .yamllint config to increase line-length limit if team prefers.
