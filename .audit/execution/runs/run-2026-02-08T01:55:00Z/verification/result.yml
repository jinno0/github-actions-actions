interpretation:
  summary: |
    Verification run completed successfully. No regressions detected.
    This execution run verified that ISS-NEW-001 (YAML syntax errors) has been
    resolved from a previous commit. No code changes were made in this run
    as the proposed improvements were either already applied (PR-004) or
    deferred as low-priority (PR-005).

  state: "STABLE"
  recommendation: "Continue with next improvement cycle focusing on higher-priority gaps"
