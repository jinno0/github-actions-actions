interpretation:
  summary: |
    This execution run verified that PR-002 and PR-004 from the previous execution
    are still in place and functioning correctly. No new changes were applied.

    Key findings:
    - Test coverage: 92.99% (stable, well above 70% target)
    - Documentation: 100% coverage maintained
    - Both documentation PRs (PR-002, PR-004) are in place
    - Progress on data collection and pilot projects is BLOCKED

    - "ISS-NEW-002: Pilot projects are placeholders (blocks PR-001, PR-003)"
    - "ISS-NEW-004: Test coverage measurement inconsistency needs investigation"

  next_cycle_focus:
    - "Resolve ISS-NEW-002: Identify real pilot projects (requires human input)"
    - "Resolve ISS-NEW-001: Enable data collection in pilot projects"
    - "Investigate ISS-NEW-004: Coverage measurement discrepancy (92.99% vs 11.11%)"
    - "Execute PR-001: Calculate baseline acceptance rate (after ISS-NEW-001 resolved)"
