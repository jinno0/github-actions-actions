+# Review Data Collection Diagnosis
+
+**Date:** 2026-02-07
+**Issue:** `metrics/review_metrics.json` does not exist
+**Impact:** Cannot calculate baseline acceptance rate
+**Priority:** HIGH
+
+---
+
+## Current Status
+
+❌ **File Missing:** `metrics/review_metrics.json` does not exist
+⚠️ **Pilot Projects:** Unverified (currently placeholders in ADOPTION.md)
+❓ **Action Status:** Unknown if running in pilot projects
+
+### Evidence
+```bash
+$ ls -la metrics/review_metrics.json
+ls: cannot access 'metrics/review_metrics.json': No such file or directory
+```
+
+### Impact on Project Goals
+
+This issue blocks:
+- **GAP-001 Completion:** Baseline acceptance rate cannot be calculated without data
+- **Phase 2 Execution:** User feedback collection requires actual review data
+- **Phase 4 Execution:** False positive analysis needs 20+ reviews
+- **Weekly Reports:** Automated quality reports have no data to report
+
+---
+
+## Root Cause Hypotheses
+
+### Hypothesis 1: Pilot Projects Not Using Action (HIGH LIKELIHOOD - 70%)
+
+**Evidence:**
+- ADOPTION.md shows placeholder repos (`example/repo-1`, `example/repo-2`)
+- No actual pilot projects verified yet (ISS-NEW-002)
+- If Actions aren't running, no data is collected
+
+**Impact:**
+- No Action runs = No data collected
+- Baseline cannot be calculated
+- Quality improvements cannot be measured
+
+**Resolution Required:**
+1. Complete PR-003 to identify real pilot projects
+2. Verify these projects have `review-and-merge` workflows enabled
+3. Check recent workflow runs to confirm Action is triggering
+
+**Verification Commands:**
+```bash
+# For each pilot project:
+gh repo view ORG/REPO --json workflows
+gh workflow list --repo ORG/REPO
+gh workflow view review-and-merge --repo ORG/REPO
+gh run list --workflow=review-and-merge --repo ORG/REPO --limit 10
+```
+
+---
+
+### Hypothesis 2: Metrics Collection Not Enabled (MEDIUM LIKELIHOOD - 25%)
+
+**Evidence:**
+- `scripts/calculate_acceptance_rate.py` exists and works
+- Infrastructure ready, but no input data
+- May not be configured in pilot project workflows
+
+**Impact:**
+- Action runs but doesn't save review outcomes
+- `metrics/review_metrics.json` never gets created
+- No data for baseline calculation
+
+**Possible Causes:**
+1. `REVIEW_METRICS_FILE` environment variable not set
+2. Workflow lacks `contents: write` permission
+3. Metrics collection code commented out or missing
+4. File path incorrect (relative vs absolute)
+
+**Resolution Required:**
+1. Check pilot project workflow files
+2. Verify `REVIEW_METRICS_FILE` is configured
+3. Confirm workflow has write permissions
+4. Check Action template code for metrics writing
+
+**Verification Commands:**
+```bash
+# Check workflow configuration
+cat .github/workflows/*review*.yml | grep -A 5 -B 5 "REVIEW_METRICS_FILE"
+
+# Check permissions
+cat .github/workflows/*review*.yml | grep -A 3 "permissions:"
+
+# Check for write permission
+cat .github/workflows/*review*.yml | grep "contents: write"
+```
+
+**Example Fix:**
+```yaml
+# Add to pilot project workflow:
+env:
+  REVIEW_METRICS_FILE: ${{ github.workspace }}/metrics/review_metrics.json
+
+permissions:
+  contents: write  # Allow writing to repository
+  pull-requests: write
+```
+
+---
+
+### Hypothesis 3: Metrics File Path Issue (LOW LIKELIHOOD - 5%)
+
+**Evidence:**
+- File path may be relative vs absolute
+- Working directory may differ from expected
+- GitHub Actions workspace context issue
+
+**Impact:**
+- Action tries to write but fails silently
+- File created in wrong location
+- Cannot find file when calculating metrics
+
+**Resolution Required:**
+1. Check Action code for file path construction
+2. Verify GitHub Actions workspace context
+3. Use absolute paths: `${{ github.workspace }}/metrics/review_metrics.json`
+

+
+## Diagnostic Checklist for Pilot Project Administrators
+
+Please run these commands in each pilot project repository:
+
+### Step 1: Verify Workflow Exists
+```bash
+# Check if review-and-merge workflow exists
+gh workflow list --search review-and-merge
+
+# Expected output: review-and-merge.yml active
+```
+
+### Step 2: Check Workflow Runs
+```bash
+# Check recent workflow runs
+gh run list --workflow=review-and-merge.yml --limit 10
+
+# Look for: recent runs (last 30 days)
+# If no runs: workflow not triggering
+```
+
+### Step 3: Check Workflow Configuration
+```bash
+# View workflow file
+cat .github/workflows/*review*.yml | grep -A 5 -B 5 "REVIEW_METRICS_FILE"
+
+# Expected: env.REVIEW_METRICS_FILE is set
+# If missing: metrics collection not enabled
+```
+
+### Step 4: Check Permissions
+```bash
+# Check workflow permissions
+cat .github/workflows/*review*.yml | grep -A 3 "permissions:"
+
+# Expected: contents: write
+# If missing: cannot write to metrics file
+```
+
+### Step 5: Check Recent Logs for Errors
+```bash
+# Check recent workflow logs
+gh run view --log-failed | tail -100
+
+# Look for: Permission denied, File not found, etc.
+```
+
+### Step 6: Verify metrics Directory
+```bash
+# Check if metrics directory exists
+ls -la metrics/
+
+# Expected: metrics/review_metrics.json exists
+# If missing: data collection not working
+```
+
+---
+
+## Resolution Steps
+
+### Phase 1: Verify Pilot Projects (PR-003) - IMMEDIATE
+
+**Status:** BLOCKED (requires human input)
+
+1. [ ] Identify actual repositories using `review-and-merge`
+2. [ ] Confirm workflows are enabled
+3. [ ] Check recent workflow runs
+4. [ ] Document contact information
+
+**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours (human time)
+
+---
+
+### Phase 2: Enable Metrics Collection - SHORT-TERM
+
+**Once pilot projects are identified:**
+
+If workflows exist but don't collect metrics:
+
+1. **Add Environment Variable:**
+   ```yaml
+   env:
+     REVIEW_METRICS_FILE: ${{ github.workspace }}/metrics/review_metrics.json
+   ```
+
+2. **Add Write Permission:**
+   ```yaml
+   permissions:
+     contents: write  # Allow writing to repository
+     pull-requests: write
+     issues: write
+   ```
+
+3. **Create metrics Directory:**
+   ```bash
+   mkdir -p metrics
+   echo '{"reviews":[]}' > metrics/review_metrics.json
+   git add metrics/
+   git commit -m "chore: initialize review metrics file"
+   ```
+
+4. **Push Changes:**
+   ```bash
+   git push
+   ```
+
+**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours per pilot project
+
+---
+
+### Phase 3: Verify Data Collection - AFTER 7 DAYS
+
+1. [ ] Check that `metrics/review_metrics.json` exists
+2. [ ] Verify file contains review data
+3. [ ] Run: `python scripts/calculate_acceptance_rate.py`
+4. [ ] Calculate baseline acceptance rate
+5. [ ] Update baseline report with actual values
+
+**Verification Commands:**
+```bash
+# Check file exists and has data
+test -f metrics/review_metrics.json && cat metrics/review_metrics.json | jq '.reviews | length'
+
+# Should show: > 0 (at least 5 reviews recommended)
+```
+
+---
+
+## Success Criteria
+
+This issue is resolved when:
+
+- [ ] Both pilot projects identified and verified
+- [ ] Both have metrics collection enabled in workflows
+- [ ] `metrics/review_metrics.json` exists in both projects
+- [ ] At least 5 reviews collected within 7 days
+- [ ] `scripts/calculate_acceptance_rate.py` can read the file
+- [ ] Baseline acceptance rate can be calculated
+- [ ] Baseline report updated with actual values
+
+---
+
+## Timeline Estimate
+
+| Phase | Action | Duration | Dependencies |
+|-------|--------|----------|--------------|
+| **Phase 1** | Identify pilot projects | 2-4 hours | Human input required |
+| **Phase 2** | Enable metrics collection | 1-2 hours | Phase 1 complete |
+| **Phase 3** | Verify data collection | 7 days | Phase 2 complete |
+| **Phase 4** | Calculate baseline | 1 hour | 20+ reviews collected |
+
+**Total Estimated Time:** 10-14 days (mostly waiting for data collection)
+
