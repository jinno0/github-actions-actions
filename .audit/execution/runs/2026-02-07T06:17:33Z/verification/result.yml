interpretation:
  summary: |
    Partial execution completed. PR-004 (data collection diagnosis) was successfully executed,
    creating comprehensive documentation of the issue and resolution path. PR-003 (pilot project
    identification) was documented but not executed due to requiring human input.

  what_was_accomplished:
    - "✅ Root cause analysis of missing review data (3 hypotheses with likelihoods)"
    - "✅ Comprehensive diagnostic document for pilot project admins"
    - "✅ README updated with transparent notice about data collection issue"
    - "✅ Step-by-step resolution guide with verification commands"
    - "✅ All tests passing (92.99% coverage maintained)"

  what_awaits_human_input:
    - "⏸️ PR-003: Identify real pilot projects (ISS-NEW-002)"
    - "⏸️ Verify pilot projects have review-and-merge workflows enabled"
    - "⏸️ Enable metrics collection in pilot project workflows"
    - "⏸️ Calculate actual baseline acceptance rate (after 20+ reviews)"

  blockers_identified:
    - blocker: "ISS-NEW-002: Pilot projects are placeholders"
      impact: "Cannot verify Actions are running or enable data collection"
      resolution: "Human must identify real pilot projects"
      estimated_time: "2-4 hours"

    - blocker: "ISS-NEW-001: Review data collection not working"
      impact: "Cannot calculate baseline acceptance rate"
      resolution: "Depends on ISS-NEW-002; enable metrics collection in pilot workflows"
      estimated_time: "1-2 hours per project + 7 days data collection"

  remaining_work:
    - "PR-003 execution: Update ADOPTION.md with real pilot projects (awaiting human input)"
    - "Verify pilot project workflows are active (requires real repo access)"
    - "Enable metrics collection in pilot workflows (requires real repo access)"
    - "Collect 20+ reviews for statistical significance (7+ days after enablement)"
    - "Calculate actual baseline acceptance rate"
    - "Complete Phase 2 (User Feedback Collection)"

  next_cycle_focus:
    - "After human provides pilot project info: Execute PR-003 to update ADOPTION.md"
    - "After PR-003: Verify and enable metrics collection in pilot projects"
    - "After 7+ days of data collection: Calculate baseline acceptance rate"
    - "Once baseline established: Proceed to Phase 2 (GAP-002)"

  summary: "455 passed, 2 skipped in 0.86s"
  coverage: "92.99%"
  regression: false
  new_failures: 0

risks_documented:
  - risk: "Pilot projects may not actually be using Actions"
    likelihood: "high"
    impact: "Would require re-evaluation of Phase 3 adoption claims"
    mitigation: "Verify with pilot teams ASAP (PR-003)"

  - risk: "Data collection may require infrastructure changes"
    likelihood: "medium"
    impact: "Could add 1-2 weeks delay to baseline calculation"
    mitigation: "Documented resolution steps in diagnosis document"

  - risk: "Statistical significance may take longer than expected"
    likelihood: "low"
    impact: "Baseline calculation delayed if review volume is low"
    mitigation: "Monitor weekly and extend collection period if needed"
