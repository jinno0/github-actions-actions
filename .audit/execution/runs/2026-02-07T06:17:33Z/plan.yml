  # PRs to execute in this run
  prs_to_apply:

execution_constraints:
  # CRITICAL: ISS-NEW-002 requires human input
  # - Cannot identify real pilot projects without org access
  # - Requires contacting team leads for actual repo information
  human_input_required:
    - issue: "ISS-NEW-002: Identify real pilot projects"
      action: "Update ADOPTION.md with actual repository URLs and contacts"
      reason: "Executor lacks access to organization's private repository information"
      estimated_effort: "2-4 hours (human time)"

success_criteria:
  - id: "SC-003"
    description: "Information request documented for pilot project identification"
    verification: "PR-003 created with clear instructions and template"

  - id: "SC-004"
    description: "Root cause of missing review data documented"
    verification: "PR-004 diagnosis complete with actionable recommendations"

rollback_triggers:
  - "Test failures"
  - "Breaking changes to existing functionality"
  - "Documentation that contradicts established facts"

# Execution strategy adjusted for human-input requirements
strategy: "document_and_request"  # Instead of "apply", we document what needs human action
notes:
  - "This run focuses on DOCUMENTING blockers rather than resolving them"
  - "PR-003 creates a template for humans to fill in missing information"
  - "PR-004 provides diagnostic information to enable data collection fixes"
  - "Next cycle can proceed once humans provide real pilot project information"
