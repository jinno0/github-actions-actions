summary: |
  PR-001 (Adoption Campaign) has been successfully applied.

  Changes made:
  1. Added Quick Start guide (5-minute setup)
  2. Added Pilot Program section with benefits
  3. Added External Adopters table template
  4. Added Adoption Success Stories template
  5. Added tracking adoption section with scan_adoption.py usage

  The scan_adoption.py script already exists and is well-implemented,
  so no code changes were needed for that component.

  Expected effects:
  - Short-term (1 month): 3+ pilot adopters
  - Mid-term (3 months): 5+ full adopters
  - Long-term (6 months): Published success stories

  Verification: All changes are non-code documentation updates,
  so no test failures or build errors expected.
