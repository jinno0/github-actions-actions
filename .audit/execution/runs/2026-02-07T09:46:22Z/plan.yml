  rationale: |
    PR-006 is a documentation-only update that reflects an already-resolved issue.
    This does not close any gaps or resolve blockers, but it maintains audit
    accuracy by updating intent.yml to match the verified state.

    PR-005 requires human input and cannot be executed autonomously.
    The improvement cycle will remain blocked until pilot projects are identified.
