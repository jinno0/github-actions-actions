interpretation:
  summary: |
    PR-006 successfully applied. This was a documentation-only update that
    reflects the resolution of ISS-NEW-004 (test coverage discrepancy).

    What was verified:
    - ASM-003 confidence upgraded: low → high
    - ASM-003 status changed: needs_revision → confirmed
    - Coverage discrepancy note removed from value field
    - Verification metadata added (date, method)

    What this means:
    The audit metadata now accurately reflects the verified state that
    both coverage.json and pytest --cov report 92.99% coverage. The
    assumption about test coverage has been promoted from "needs revision"
    to "confirmed" with high confidence.

    What was NOT achieved:
    - No gaps were closed (this was a documentation update only)
    - No blockers were resolved (ISS-NEW-001, ISS-NEW-002 remain)
    - No functional improvements to the codebase
    - PR-005 remains BLOCKED awaiting human input

  remaining_blockers:
    - "ISS-NEW-001: Review metrics collection not working (blocks GAP-001, GAP-003, GAP-004)"
    - "ISS-NEW-002: Pilot projects are placeholders (blocks all autonomous progress)"

  remaining_gaps:
    - "GAP-001: Baseline acceptance rate not established (blocked by ISS-NEW-001, ISS-NEW-002)"
    - "GAP-002: Pilot project feedback insufficient (blocked by ISS-NEW-002)"
    - "GAP-003: Telemetry visualization missing (blocked by ISS-NEW-001, ISS-NEW-002)"
    - "GAP-004: AI review false positive tracking insufficient (blocked by ISS-NEW-002)"
    - "GAP-005: Custom rule adoption unknown (blocked by ISS-NEW-002)"

  next_cycle_focus:
    - "PR-005 requires human input to identify actual pilot projects"
    - "Once ISS-NEW-002 is resolved, can proceed with ISS-NEW-001 (data collection)"
    - "After 7 days of data collection, can execute PR-001 (baseline calculation)"

  quality_assessment:
    accuracy: "high"
    completeness: "complete (for PR-006 scope)"
    clarity: "high"
    verifiability: "fully verifiable via YAML structure"
