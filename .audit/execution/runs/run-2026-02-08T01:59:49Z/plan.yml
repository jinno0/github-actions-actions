# Scope
scope:
  prs_to_apply: []
  prs_deferred: ["PR-001", "PR-002"]
  rationale: >
    PR-001 and PR-002 require organizational actions and pilot project adoption
    which cannot be executed autonomously by this agent. These proposals involve:
    - PR-001: Selecting pilot projects and conducting workshops
    - PR-002: Setting up data collection in production environments

    Based on gap analysis, the independent technical tasks (GAP-002, GAP-003,
    GAP-006, GAP-007) should be prioritized instead.

# Success Criteria
success_criteria:
  - id: "SC-001"
    source: "QA-001 (intent.yml)"
    target: "Test coverage >= 70%"
    verification: "pytest --cov=actions --cov=scripts --cov-report=term"
    current_status: "92.99% (already achieved)"

  - id: "SC-002"
    source: "QA-002 (intent.yml)"
    target: "AI review acceptance rate >= 70%"
    verification: "python scripts/calculate_acceptance_rate.py --time-period 30d"
    current_status: "Cannot measure - no production data"

  - id: "SC-003"
    source: "QA-003 (intent.yml)"
    target: "Action structure validation 100%"
    verification: "pytest tests/ -k 'test_action' -v"
    current_status: "139 passed vs expected 455 (GAP-003)"

# Rollback Triggers
rollback_triggers:
  - "Verification test failures"
  - "Build errors"
  - "Existing test breakage"

# Technical Focus Areas (from gap.yml)
technical_focus:
  immediate:
    - gap_id: "GAP-002"
      description: "Create missing integration test"
      action: "Identify and create missing integration test file"
      priority: "medium"
      feasibility: "high"

    - gap_id: "GAP-003"
      description: "Fix action structure test target value"
      action: "Investigate and correct expected test count (455 vs 139)"
      priority: "medium"
      feasibility: "high"

    - gap_id: "GAP-007"
      description: "Document coverage calculation scope"
      action: "Update README.md to clarify coverage scope (actions/ and scripts/ only)"
      priority: "low"
      feasibility: "high"

    - gap_id: "GAP-006"
      description: "Claude CLI version compatibility testing"
      action: "Test across multiple Claude CLI versions"
      priority: "high"
      feasibility: "medium"
      rationale: "Requires multiple CLI versions for testing"

    - gap_id: "GAP-008"
      description: "Improve generate_telemetry_report.py coverage"
      action: "Add edge case tests"
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Depends on GAP-005 (telemetry activation)"

    - gap_id: "GAP-009"
      description: "Improve acceptance_tracker.py coverage"
      action: "Add mock data tests"
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Depends on GAP-001 (production data)"

# Execution Strategy
strategy:
  approach: "focus_on_independent_technical_tasks"
  reasoning: >
    PR-001 and PR-002 require organizational coordination and pilot project
    adoption, which are outside the scope of autonomous technical execution.
    Instead, focus on the independent technical gaps that can be addressed:
    1. GAP-002: Missing integration test
    2. GAP-003: Test count mismatch
    3. GAP-007: Documentation clarity

    These improvements will enhance code quality while waiting for
    organizational adoption progress.
