  summary: |
    Execution successful with 2 improvements applied:
    1. PR-001: YAML linting integrated into CI (ISS-006 resolved)
    2. PR-002: CLI version requirements documented (ISS-002 resolved)

    Overall Status: IMPROVED
    - Quality infrastructure enhanced (yamllint in CI)
    - Documentation improved (CLI versioning)
    - No regressions (all 455 tests passing)
    - Test coverage maintained at 92.99%

  remaining_work:
    - "Fix 3 YAML errors found by yamllint (missing newlines, blank lines)"
    - "Consider addressing 18 YAML warnings incrementally (line length)"
    - "PR-003: Test coverage improvement (deferred - requires detailed analysis)"
    - "ISS-001, ISS-003, ISS-004: Require external team coordination"

  next_cycle_focus:
    - "Address PR-003 (test coverage improvement to 95%+)"
    - "Fix identified YAML errors"
    - "Onboard pilot projects (ISS-001) to enable metrics collection"
    - "Execute dry-run validation (ISS-005)"

  QA-002_dry_run: "NOT_VERIFIED - requires manual execution"
  QA-003_yaml_syntax: "ESTABLISHED - CI now validates YAML"
  QA-004_acceptance_rate: "NO_DATA - requires production adoption"

key_achievements:
  - "YAML linting now runs on every PR and push to main/develop"
  - "CLI version management framework established"
  - "Version testing guide provides structured approach to CLI updates"
  - "All changes verified with test suite (455 passing)"

risks_identified:
  - "3 YAML errors exist but are non-blocking (should be fixed)"
  - "18 YAML warnings (line length > 120) - style guidelines"
  - "PR-003 deferred - test coverage improvement not yet addressed"

rollback_decisions:
  performed: false
  reason: "No regressions detected, all tests passing, improvements successful"
