    PR-002 successfully documented Claude CLI version requirements:
    - Added "Claude Code CLI バージョン" section to README.md
    - Created comprehensive CLI version testing guide
    - Added version pinning recommendation to example workflow
    - Documented installation methods and version compatibility checks

    Note: Used "最新の安定版" instead of specific version number
    since actual minimum version was not determinable from codebase.
    Documentation provides framework for version management.

verification_steps_taken:

  - "Created CLI version testing guide with checklist"
  - "Updated review-and-merge example with version pinning comment"
  - "Verified documentation is clear and actionable"

notes: |
  PR-002 successfully addressed ISS-002 gap:
  - README now documents CLI version requirements
  - Testing guide provides structured approach to version validation
  - Examples show version pinning best practice
  - Framework established for ongoing version management

  Limitations:
  - Specific minimum version not determinable (used "latest stable")
  - Only updated one example workflow (representative)
  - CLI version testing not executed (would require actual CLI access)

  Next steps (not in this PR):
  - Test with specific CLI versions to determine actual minimum
  - Update remaining example workflows with version comments
  - Execute version testing checklist when CLI available
