  # 2. Effective Improvements (14の提案が正しかった証拠)
  effective_improvements:

      actual_impact: "verified"
      evidence: |
        YAML syntax errors (ISS-NEW-001) confirmed resolved.
        - 3 syntax errors fixed in previous commit (3da4192)
        - yamllint verification: 0 errors
        - All action.yml files now have valid YAML syntax
      lessons: "Previous cycle's YAML linting integration (PR-001) successfully identified and enabled fixing of syntax errors"
      recommendation: "Continue YAML validation as part of CI quality gates"

  # 3. Failed Improvements (14の提案に問題があった証拠)

  # 4. Deferred Improvements (適用を見送った改善)
  deferred_improvements:
    - pr_id: "PR-005"
      gap_resolved: "ISS-NEW-002"
      reason: "deferred"
      deferral_reason: |
        Low-priority style improvement. Line-length warnings are cosmetic,
        not functional issues. Would require 1-2 hours for minimal benefit.
        Current warnings reduced from 18 to 9 (likely from previous cleanup).
      recommended_fix: "Defer to maintenance cycle or address incrementally during natural code reviews"
      lessons: "Style improvements should be weighed against functional improvements. Not all warnings require immediate attention."
      estimated_effort: "1-2 hours (if executed later)"

    - pr_id: "PR-003"
      gap_resolved: "ISS-007"
      reason: "deferred_from_previous_cycle"
      deferral_reason: "Requires detailed analysis of 65 uncovered lines and new test file creation. Better suited for dedicated testing-focused cycle."
      recommended_fix: "Execute as file-specific PRs starting with lowest coverage file (generate_telemetry_report.py at 78.29%)"
      lessons: "Large improvements should be split into smaller, focused PRs"

    - gap_id: "ISS-001"
      reason: "requires_external_coordination"
      deferral_reason: "Pilot onboarding requires org leadership approval and coordination with pilot project teams"
      recommended_fix: "Executor should focus on technical improvements. Org leadership should handle adoption."

    - gap_id: "ISS-003"
      reason: "requires_external_coordination"
      deferral_reason: "Runner inventory requires access to organization infrastructure and coordination with DevOps team"
      recommended_fix: "Create separate checklist for infrastructure team to execute"

    - gap_id: "ISS-004"
      reason: "depends_on_other_gaps"
      deferral_reason: "Metrics collection requires pilot projects (ISS-001) to be onboarded first"
      recommended_fix: "Address ISS-001 first, then enable metrics collection"

    - gap_id: "ISS-005"
      reason: "requires_manual_execution"
      deferral_reason: "Dry-run workflow exists but requires manual execution. Executor focuses on code/config changes."
      recommended_fix: "Document dry-run execution as manual step for maintainers"

    - gap_id: "ISS-008"
      reason: "low_priority"
      deferral_reason: "AGENTS.md compliance review is lower priority than functional improvements"
      recommended_fix: "Defer to maintenance cycle"

  # 5. New Issues Discovered (14が次に分析すべき対象)
  new_issues_discovered: []  # No new issues in this verification cycle

  # 6. Next Cycle Suggestions
  next_cycle_suggestions:
    - priority: 1
      action: "Execute PR-003 (test coverage improvement)"
      reason: "File-specific approach - focus on lowest coverage file first"
      suggestion: "Start with generate_telemetry_report.py (78.29% coverage), then acceptance_tracker.py (88.89%)"
      estimated_effort: "4-5 hours of analysis + test writing"

    - priority: 2
      action: "Execute dry-run validation (ISS-005)"
      reason: "Verify all actions pass dry-run"
      suggestion: "Document as manual step or create automated verification"
      estimated_effort: "30 minutes execution + documentation"

    - priority: 3
      action: "Address ISS-NEW-002 (optional)"
      reason: "Reduce YAML line length warnings from 9 to 0"
      suggestion: "Incremental fixes during natural code review cycle, or adjust .yamllint config"
      estimated_effort: "1-2 hours"

  # 7. Process Feedback for Auditor
  auditor_improvement_suggestions:
    - suggestion: "Distinguish between technical and organizational gaps"
      reason: "Executor can only fix technical issues. ISS-001, ISS-003 require external teams."
      recommendation: "Tag gaps as 'technical', 'organizational', 'infrastructure' so executor knows what to apply"
      examples: |
        Current: All gaps listed together
        Proposed:
        - ISS-001 [organizational]: Pilot onboarding
        - ISS-002 [technical]: CLI version documentation
        - ISS-003 [infrastructure]: Runner inventory

    - suggestion: "Include verification scripts in audit output"
      reason: "Section 2.1 requires verify_core_functions.py but it wasn't generated."
      recommendation: "Generate verification scripts as part of audit Phase 4"
      impact: "Would enable automated core function testing"

    - suggestion: "Prioritize gaps by effort and impact"
      reason: "PR-005 (line length) is low-impact but was proposed for execution"
      recommendation: "Use impact/effort matrix to prioritize gaps"
      examples: |
        High Impact / Low Effort → Execute immediately
        High Impact / High Effort → Plan for next cycle
        Low Impact / Low Effort → Defer or do incrementally
        Low Impact / High Effort → Skip
