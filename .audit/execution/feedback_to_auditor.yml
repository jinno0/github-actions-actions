  # === 2. Effective Improvements ===
  effective_improvements:
    - pr_id: "PR-004"
      actual_impact: "high"
      evidence: "Comprehensive diagnostic document created (337 lines)"
      lessons:
        - "Documentation with clear hypotheses and resolution steps is highly actionable"
        - "Providing diagnostic commands enables pilot project admins to self-serve"
        - "Transparency about blockers (ISS-NEW-002) prevents confusion"

  failed_improvements:
    - pr_id: "PR-003"
      failure_reason: "Requires human input (not a technical failure)"
      description: "Cannot identify real pilot projects without organization access"
      blocker: "ISS-NEW-002"
      recommended_fix: "Human must identify real pilot repositories"

  # === 4. New Issues Discovered ===

    - id: "ISS-NEW-003"
      description: "Pilot project verification may invalidate adoption claims"
      severity: "high"
      recommended_action: "Make pilot project identification the HIGHEST priority"

  # === 5. Next Cycle Suggestions ===
  next_cycle_suggestions:
    - priority: 1
      action: "Await human input for PR-003 (real pilot project identification)"
      blocks: "Everything else"
    - suggestion: "Auditor should generate PR proposal files during audit phase"
      reason: "Would save executor time; current approach requires executor to generate PR proposals"
