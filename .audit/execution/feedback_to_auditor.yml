      evidence: |
        CLI version requirements documented comprehensively.
        - README.md updated with version section
        - Testing guide created (docs/cli-version-testing.md)
        - Version pinning best practices documented

  deferred_improvements:
    - pr_id: "PR-003"
      gap_resolved: "ISS-007"
      reason: "deferred"
      deferral_reason: "Requires detailed analysis of 65 uncovered lines across multiple files. Would need to generate new test files, which is better suited for dedicated testing-focused cycle."
      recommended_fix: "Break into smaller, focused PRs targeting specific files (e.g., focus on generate_telemetry_report.py first)"
      lessons: "Large coverage improvements should be split into file-specific PRs"

    - gap_id: "ISS-003"
      reason: "requires_external_coordination"
      deferral_reason: "Runner inventory requires access to organization infrastructure and coordination with DevOps team"

        Could not determine actual minimum Claude CLI version from codebase.
        Used "latest stable" in documentation, but this is not specific.
      impact: "Medium - users may install incompatible CLI version"
      recommended_action: |
        1. Test with specific CLI versions to determine minimum
        2. Check Claude Code CLI release notes for breaking changes
        3. Update README.md with specific minimum version
      blocked_by: "Requires access to Claude CLI for testing"

  # 5. Next Cycle Suggestions

      estimated_effort: "15 minutes"

    - priority: 2
      action: "Execute PR-003 (test coverage improvement)"
      reason: "File-specific approach - focus on lowest coverage file first"
      suggestion: "Split into PR-003a (generate_telemetry_report.py), PR-003b (acceptance_tracker.py), etc."

    - priority: 3
      action: "Determine actual minimum CLI version"

      reason: "Verify all actions pass dry-run"
      suggestion: "Document as manual step or create automated verification"

  # 6. Process Feedback for Auditor
  auditor_improvement_suggestions:
    - suggestion: "Generate specific PR-XXX.md files instead of just roadmap"
      reason: "Executor had to convert roadmap into PR proposals. Auditor should generate executable PR files directly."
      examples: |
        Instead of:
        proposal/roadmap.md (high-level actions)

        Generate:
        proposal/changes/PR-001.md (specific file changes, verification steps)
        proposal/changes/PR-002.md (specific file changes, verification steps)

    - suggestion: "Include verification scripts in audit output"
      reason: "Section 2.1 requires verify_core_functions.py but it wasn't generated."
      recommendation: "Generate verification scripts as part of audit Phase 4"

    - suggestion: "Distinguish technical vs. organizational gaps"
      reason: "Executor can only fix technical issues. ISS-001, ISS-003 require external teams."
      recommendation: "Tag gaps as 'technical', 'organizational', 'infrastructure' so executor knows what to apply"
