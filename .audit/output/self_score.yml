# Score Details
score_details:
  purpose_alignment:
    score: 5
    max: 5
    rationale: "Audit focused on repo's stated mission and quality attributes. Identified critical gaps in Dry Run verification that directly impact the repository's safety claims."
    evidence:
      - "Aligned with intent.yml core_functions"
      - "Verified quality attributes (test coverage, acceptance rate)"
      - "Identified documentation-implementation mismatch"

  evidence_soundness:
    score: 5
    max: 5
    rationale: "Clear separation of facts (20), inferences (2), and unknowns (2). All claims have sources and confidence levels."
    evidence:
      - "20 facts with source references"
      - "2 inferences with reasoning"
      - "2 unknowns with verification methods"
      - "Previous execution feedback incorporated"

  implementability:
    score: 4
    max: 5
    rationale: "PR-003 is actionable with clear steps. Dry Run gap has two concrete options. Minor deduction: CF-003/CF-006 verification scripts are designed but not yet executed."
    evidence:
      - "PR-003 includes verification script design"
      - "Dry Run resolution has 2 clear options"
      - "Test data preparation plan included"
      - "Gap: Verification scripts not executed in this cycle"

  risk_management:
    score: 4
    max: 5
    rationale: "Identified critical Dry Run gap. Proposed rollback plans. Minor deduction: Implementation risks for 10 Actions' Dry Run not fully assessed."
    evidence:
      - "Critical findings prioritized (GAP-003)"
      - "Rollback plans included for proposals"
      - "Alternatives considered and documented"
      - "Gap: Large-scale implementation risks not quantified"

  verifiability:
    score: 5
    max: 5
    rationale: "All verification criteria defined. Execution results saved. Reproducible with documented commands."
    evidence:
      - "verify_core_functions.py executed"
      - "Results saved to .audit/output/verification_result.json"
      - "Before/after metrics captured"
      - "Reproducibility instructions in summary.md"

  cost_optimization:
    score: 5
    max: 5
    rationale: "Efficient use of resources. Focused on high-impact gaps. No unnecessary file generation. Within budget limits."
    evidence:
      - "Targeted 3 priority gaps (not all 7)"
      - "Leveraged previous execution results"
      - "No redundant analysis"
      - "Within scan_budget and proposal_budget limits"

  collective_intelligence:
    score: 3
    max: 5
    rationale: "Outputs are clear but could include more visual artifacts. Team review process not explicitly designed."
    evidence:
      - "summary.md is comprehensive"
      - "next_questions.md enables feedback"
      - "Gap: No diagrams or visual summaries"
      - "Gap: No explicit review checklist for team"

# Overall Assessment
overall_assessment: |
  This audit run demonstrated strong improvement (31/35 = 89%) over the previous cycle.
  Key strengths include evidence soundness, verifiability, and purpose alignment.
  Primary improvement areas are visual artifacts for team review and risk quantification
  for large-scale changes (Dry Run implementation). The audit successfully identified
  critical gaps and generated actionable proposals within resource constraints.

# Next Cycle Goals
next_cycle_goals:
  target_score: 34
  focus_areas:
    - "Add visual summaries (gap matrix, verification chart)"
    - "Execute CF-003/CF-006 verification before proposing"
    - "Quantify Dry Run implementation effort and risks"
    - "Maintain current strengths (evidence, verifiability, alignment)"
