# === Detailed Evaluation ===

## 1. Purpose Alignment (5/5) ✅

**Criteria**: Audit aligns with Repo Intent (intent.yml)

**Assessment**:
- ✅ Audit focused on verifying 6 core functions defined in intent.yml
- ✅ Addressed gap between claimed purpose (100% action structure) vs actual (100% achieved)
- ✅ Identified critical documentation gap blocking adoption (ISS-001)
- ✅ Proposals directly support Phase 3 goals (Stabilization & Adoption)

**Evidence**:
- All 7 gaps mapped to intent violations (e.g., ISS-001 → mission.provided_value)
- PR-001 directly addresses "組織内の複数のリポジトリで採用される" success condition

**No improvements needed** - Audit fully aligned with repository purpose.

---

## 2. Evidence Soundness (5/5) ✅

**Criteria**: Facts/inferences/unknowns properly separated

**Assessment**:
- ✅ All claims backed by file evidence (e.g., "C-001: find actions -name 'action.yml'")
- ✅ 15 claims with clear type classification (fact, inference, unknown)
- ✅ Confidence levels assigned (0.0-1.0)
- ✅ Unknowns explicitly identified (C-014, C-015)

**Evidence**:
- claims.ndjson contains 15 well-documented claims
- audit_log.ndjson records 5 judgment decisions with rationale
- Every gap in gap.yml has evidence array

**No improvements needed** - Evidence collection was thorough and well-structured.

---

## 3. Implementability (4/5) ⚠️

**Criteria**: Concrete files/steps/tests provided

**Assessment**:
- ✅ PR-001: Specific file to edit (README.md), clear steps
- ✅ PR-003: Complete Python script provided
- ✅ Roadmap with effort estimates (15 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, etc.)
- ⚠️ PR-002: Enhanced validation requires more design (mock Claude CLI behavior)

**Evidence**:
- verify_core_functions.py: 200+ lines of working code
- roadmap.md: 5-phase plan with time estimates
- PR proposals include "Steps", "Testing", "Rollback" sections

**Improvement Needed**:
- PR-002 could benefit from more detailed implementation
- Could create actual YAML snippets for CI changes

**Action for next run**:
- Priority 1: Add more implementation details to PR-002
- Create example CI workflow file as reference

---

## 4. Risk Management (4/5) ⚠️

**Criteria**: Side effects and rollback procedures included

**Assessment**:
- ✅ All PR proposals include "Risks" section
- ✅ All PR proposals include "Rollback" section
- ✅ Alternatives considered for each proposal
- ⚠️ Some risks are qualitative without quantitative impact assessment

**Evidence**:
- PR-001: "Low: Documentation update only"
- PR-002: "Medium: Mock may not catch all real-world issues" with mitigation
- PR-003: "Low: Structural verification only"

**Improvement Needed**:
- Could add more quantitative risk assessment (e.g., probability, impact score)
- Could prioritize risks by severity

**Action for next run**:
- Consider adding risk matrix (probability × impact)
- Prioritize mitigation strategies by risk score

---

## 5. Verifiability (4/5) ⚠️

**Criteria**: Success criteria and measurement defined

**Assessment**:
- ✅ Each PR has "Success Criteria" section
- ✅ Core function verification includes measurable outcomes (5/6 passed)
- ✅ Compliance metrics calculated (85% overall, 100% structure)
- ⚠️ Some success criteria are binary (pass/fail) without gradations

**Evidence**:
- PR-001: "All 13 actions documented in README"
- PR-003: "All 6 core functions pass structural verification"
- Quality metrics table with percentages

**Improvement Needed**:
- Could add intermediate milestones for larger PRs
- Could define measurement frequency for ongoing metrics

**Action for next run**:
- Add metric collection frequency to roadmap
- Define intermediate checkpoints for multi-hour PRs

---

## 6. Cost Optimization (5/5) ✅

**Criteria**: Change scope and phasing appropriate

**Assessment**:
- ✅ Proposed changes are minimal and focused
- ✅ Prioritized by quick wins (15 min PR-001)
- ✅ Phased approach prevents over-investment (Phase 1: 3 hours total)
- ✅ Each PR is standalone (can implement independently)

**Evidence**:
- PR-001: 15 minutes for critical documentation fix
- Roadmap: Week 1 (3 hours), Week 2-3 (4 hours), Month 2 (8 hours)
- No gold-plating: focused on gaps, not nice-to-haves

**No improvements needed** - Cost optimization was excellent.

---

## 7. Collective Intelligence (3/5) ⚠️

**Criteria**: Team-reviewable artifacts available

**Assessment**:
- ✅ Summary.md is comprehensive and well-structured
- ✅ Gap analysis with priority ordering
- ✅ PR proposals with alternatives considered
- ⚠️ Missing: Review checklist for human reviewers
- ⚠️ Missing: Collaboration protocol for concurrent work

**Evidence**:
- .audit/output/summary.md: 400+ lines of detailed analysis
- .audit/proposal/roadmap.md: Phased plan with dependencies
- next_questions.md: Clear questions for user validation

**Improvement Needed**:
- Could add PR review checklist
- Could add collaboration guidelines for distributed teams
- Could create issue templates for gap tracking

**Action for next run**:
- Priority 2: Create PR review checklist
- Add issue template for tracking gap resolution
- Document collaboration protocol
