    - Assessed Phase 3 adoption status (PURPOSE.md:22-26)
    - Evaluated quality attributes against documented targets
    - Incorporated executor feedback from previous run
    - Generated specific PR proposals (PR-004, PR-005) instead of generic roadmap
  strengths:
    - "Directly addressed repository's North Star goal"
    - "Assessed adoption readiness (core to mission)"

    - "Executor feedback used to validate assumptions"
  weaknesses: []

# 3. Implementability (5/5) ✅
implementability_details:
  score: 5
  rationale: |
    Recommended actions are specific and executable:
    - Generated specific PR-XXX.md files (PR-004, PR-005) with exact commands
    - Critical gaps have clear next steps with effort estimates
    - File paths and commands provided for all fixes
    - Prioritization (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) guides execution

    - "PR-005: Incremental approach with file-by-file option"
    - "Executor feedback incorporated (split large PRs)"
    - "Technical vs organizational gaps clearly distinguished"
  weaknesses: []

    - "Core function verification script not generated (executor feedback)"

# 6. Cost Optimization (5/5) ✅
cost_optimization_details:
  score: 5
  rationale: |
    Changes are scoped and incremental:
    - PR-004: 15 minutes (quick win)
    - PR-005: 1-2 hours (incremental)
    - No major refactoring recommended
    - Leverages existing infrastructure
  strengths:
    - "All recommendations are low-cost"
    - "Quick wins prioritized (YAML errors first)"
    - "No architectural changes proposed"
    - "Uses existing quality infrastructure (yamllint)"
    - "Incremental approach allows pausing after each PR"
  weaknesses: []

# 7. Collective Intelligence (5/5) ✅
collective_intelligence_details:
  score: 5
  rationale: |
    Outputs are team-reviewable and incorporate feedback:
    - Clear summary.md with progress tracking
    - Structured gap analysis with type tags
    - next_questions.md enables dialog
    - Specific PR proposals for executor
    - Previous executor feedback addressed
  strengths:
    - "Summary document shows improvement cycle progress"
    - "Assumptions explicitly documented and validated"
    - "Executor suggestions incorporated (specific PR files, gap type tagging)"
    - "Executive summary with trend analysis"
    - "Feedback loop established (executor → auditor → executor)"
  weaknesses: []

# === Improvement Actions ===
improvement_actions:
  - priority: 1
    target: "verifiability"
    action: "Generate verify_core_functions.py script as required by Section 2.1"

# === Overall Assessment ===
overall_assessment: |
  This audit demonstrates VERY HIGH quality (94.3%, +5.7% from baseline):

  IMPROVEMENTS FROM CYCLE 1:
  - Generated specific PR-XXX.md files (executor feedback addressed)
  - Tagged gaps by type (technical/organizational/infrastructure)
  - Incorporated previous executor results in analysis
  - Added improvement cycle tracking to summary
  - Provided exact commands and effort estimates

  STRENGTHS:
  - Exceptional evidence discipline (all claims cited)
  - Strong alignment to repository mission
  - Practical, low-cost recommendations with effort estimates
  - Clear separation of fact/inference/unknown
  - Effective feedback loop (executor → auditor → executor)
  - Specific PR proposals instead of generic roadmap

  AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
  - Generate verify_core_functions.py script (Section 2.1 requirement)
  - Execute all verifications internally when possible
  - Add visual aids for stakeholder communication

  RECOMMENDATION:
  Continue current approach. Next audit should:
  1. Generate verification script as per Section 2.1
  2. Execute PR-004 and PR-005 verification
  3. Measure improvement cycle effectiveness
  4. Refine assumptions based on user feedback
