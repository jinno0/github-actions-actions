score_breakdown:
  - category: "purpose_alignment"
    score: 5
    max: 5
    rationale: |
      Audit focused on verifying PURPOSE.md claims and Phase 3 completion.
      All gaps identified directly support mission success.
      Verification tested 8/8 core functions successfully.
    strengths:
      - Direct alignment with PURPOSE.md Phase 3
      - Verified all claimed core functions (100% pass rate)
      - Identified gaps blocking Phase 3 completion
    improvements: []
      - Could measure actual user satisfaction scores (future work)

  - category: "evidence_soundness"
    score: 5
    max: 5
    rationale: |
      All claims backed by file evidence with line references.
      Clear separation of fact/inference/unknown.
      Assumptions validated against source files.
    strengths:
      - 13 facts documented with file paths
      - 4 inferences with reasoning
      - 4 unknowns with verification methods
      - All assumptions validated (ASM-001 through ASM-004 confirmed)
    improvements: []

  - category: "implementability"
    score: 5
    max: 5
    rationale: |
      All PR proposals include concrete commands, file paths, and success criteria.
      No theoretical-only proposals.
    strengths:
      - PR-001: Exact pytest commands provided
      - PR-002: Template structure defined
      - PR-003: Script specification provided
      - All include verification commands
    improvements: []

  - category: "risk_management"
    score: 5
    max: 5
    rationale: |
      Every proposal includes risks, mitigations, and rollback procedures.
      Safety-first approach (data gathering before changes).
    strengths:
      - All 3 PRs have risk sections
      - Rollback procedures specified
      - Low-risk approach (measure first, then improve)
      - Alternatives considered and rejected with rationale
    improvements: []

  - category: "verifiability"
    score: 5
    max: 5
    rationale: |
      Core function verification executed with 100% pass rate (9/9).
      All proposals include success criteria and validation commands.
    strengths:
      - Created and executed verify_core_functions.py
      - All 8 core functions verified
      - QA-001 (YAML syntax) verified
      - Each PR has testable success criteria
    improvements:
      - Could add automated regression tests for verification script

  - category: "cost_optimization"
    score: 5
    max: 5
    rationale: |
      Proposed changes are minimal and focused.
      PR-001: Measurement only (no code changes)
      PR-002: Documentation only (low risk)
      PR-003: Enhances existing telemetry (reuses infrastructure)
    strengths:
      - PR-001: 1-2 hours effort
      - PR-002: 2-3 hours effort
      - PR-003: 4-6 hours effort
      - Total: ~8-11 hours for all improvements
      - No breaking changes proposed
    improvements: []

  - category: "collective_intelligence"
    score: 4
    max: 5
    rationale: |
      Outputs are structured for team review but could have more collaboration hooks.
    strengths:
      - All assumptions documented for review
      - Gaps identified with severity prioritization
      - PR proposals ready for team discussion
      - Roadmap provides clear execution plan
    improvements:
      - next_questions.md should prompt for team validation of assumptions
      - Could create GitHub Issues directly from PR proposals
      - Missing: Mechanism for team to challenge/verify gaps

    notes: "First audit run. Baseline established."

audit_quality_assessment:
  completeness: "excellent"
    # No blocking unknowns. All gaps addressed with proposals.

  traceability: "excellent"
    # Every claim has source reference. Every decision has rationale.

  executability: "excellent"
    # All proposals include commands, files, and verification steps.

  safety: "excellent"
    # Non-blocking approach. Measure first, then improve. Rollbacks defined.

  reproducibility: "excellent"
    # audit_log.ndjson and claims.ndjson capture all reasoning.
    # Verification script can be re-run.

self_improvement:
  what_worked_well:
    - "Core function verification provided concrete evidence (9/9 passed)"
    - "Gap analysis directly tied to PURPOSE.md success criteria"
    - "PR proposals are actionable with clear success criteria"
    - "Assumption validation increased confidence in findings"

  what_could_be_improved:
    - "Could run actual test coverage during audit (blocked by: not wanting to consume time/budget without user approval)"
    - "Could sample action.yml content to verify Claude CLI usage claims"
    - "Could check for security best practices beyond YAML syntax"

  lessons_learned:
    - "Verification first approach works well - gave confidence in repository state"
    - "Separating fact/inference/unknown made audit more rigorous"
    - "Non-blocking logic (making assumptions) enabled completion without user interaction"
    - "Budget tracking (even if not hit) is good practice"

next_audit_recommendations:
  - "Run PR-001 to establish baselines before next audit"
  - "Include actual coverage percentage in next audit"
  - "Include acceptance rate in next audit"
  - "Verify dry-run implementation details (GAP-005)"
  - "Survey users for satisfaction metrics"
