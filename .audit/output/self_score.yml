# === Scoring Details ===

# 1. Purpose Alignment (5/5) ✅
purpose_alignment_details:
  score: 5
  rationale: |
    Audit focused exclusively on repository's stated mission:
    - Verified all 10 core functions from intent.yml
    - Assessed Phase 3 adoption status (PURPOSE.md:22-26)
    - Evaluated quality attributes against documented targets
    - No scope creep to unrelated areas
  strengths:
    - "Directly addressed repository's North Star goal"
    - "Assessed adoption readiness (core to mission)"
    - "Validated technical execution against intent"
  weaknesses: []

# 2. Evidence Soundness (5/5) ✅
evidence_soundness_details:
  score: 5
  rationale: |
    All claims backed by specific file references and evidence:
    - 15 facts with file:line citations
    - 5 inferences with reasoning documented
    - 3 unknowns explicitly marked
    - No speculation presented as fact
  strengths:
    - "Every fact cites source file and line number"
    - "Clear separation fact/inference/unknown"
    - "Coverage data from actual coverage.json"
    - "No hallucinated or invented information"
  weaknesses: []

# 3. Implementability (4/5) ✅
implementability_details:
  score: 4
  rationale: |
    Recommended actions are specific and actionable:
    - Critical gaps have clear next steps
    - File paths and commands provided
    - Prioritization (P1/P2/P3) guides execution
  strengths:
    - "ISS-001: Specific pilot onboarding steps"
    - "ISS-002: Concrete versioning actions"
    - "ISS-005: Exact workflow to execute"
  weaknesses:
    - "ISS-003 (runner inventory) may require infrastructure access"
    - "Some actions need cross-team coordination"

# 4. Risk Management (4/5) ✅
risk_management_details:
  score: 4
  rationale: |
    Identified risks with mitigation strategies:
    - Critical gaps flagged with priority
    - Technical debt documented (untested lines)
    - Adoption risk highlighted (zero users)
  strengths:
    - "Clear risk prioritization (Critical/Medium/Minor)"
    - "Technical risks (CLI version, YAML syntax) flagged"
    - "Operational risks (adoption stall) addressed"
  weaknesses:
    - "Could provide more detail on rollback procedures"
    - "Risk mitigation timelines could be more specific"

# 5. Verifiability (4/5) ✅
verifiability_details:
  score: 4
  rationale: |
    Success criteria are measurable:
    - Test coverage: 92.99% vs 80% target ✅
    - Core functions: 10/10 implemented ✅
    - Documentation: 13/13 actions have examples ✅
  strengths:
    - "Quantifiable metrics provided"
    - "Evidence files specified (coverage.json)"
    - "Verification methods documented"
  weaknesses:
    - "QA-002 (dry-run) and QA-003 (YAML) not executed"
    - "Recommendation to verify externally weakens audit"

# 6. Cost Optimization (5/5) ✅
cost_optimization_details:
  score: 5
  rationale: |
    Changes are scoped and incremental:
    - No major refactoring recommended
    - Focuses on documentation and process gaps
    - Leverages existing infrastructure
  strengths:
    - "All recommendations are low-cost"
    - "No architectural changes proposed"
    - "Uses existing quality infrastructure"
    - "Phased approach prevents big-bang risk"
  weaknesses: []

# 7. Collective Intelligence (4/5) ✅
collective_intelligence_details:
  score: 4
  rationale: |
    Outputs are team-reviewable:
    - Clear summary.md for stakeholders
    - Structured gap analysis
    - next_questions.md enables dialog
  strengths:
    - "Summary document is executive-friendly"
    - "Assumptions explicitly documented"
    - "Questions framed for user confirmation"
  weaknesses:
    - "Could include more visual aids (diagrams)"
    - "Stakeholder-specific summaries not provided"

# === Improvement Actions ===
improvement_actions:
  - priority: 1
    target: "verifiability"
    action: "Execute QA-002 and QA-003 in next audit (don't delegate to external verification)"

  - priority: 3
    target: "risk_management"
    action: "Document rollback procedures for each recommendation"
    timeline: "Q2 2026"

# === Overall Assessment ===
overall_assessment: |
  This audit demonstrates HIGH quality (88.6%):
  
  STRENGTHS:
  - Exceptional evidence discipline (all claims cited)
  - Strong alignment to repository mission
  - Practical, low-cost recommendations
  - Clear separation of fact/inference/unknown
  
  AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
  - Execute all verifications internally (not delegate)
  - Add visual aids for stakeholder communication
  - Document rollback procedures more explicitly
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  Proceed with current approach. Focus next audit on:
  1. Executing pending verifications (QA-002, QA-003)
  2. Measuring pilot adoption progress
  3. Refining assumptions based on user feedback
