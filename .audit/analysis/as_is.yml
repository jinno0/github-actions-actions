quality_metrics:
  strengths:
    - "Good test coverage (78.15% approaching 80% target)"
    - "All tests passing (460 tests, 2 skipped)"
    - "Complete documentation (100% coverage)"
    - "Valid YAML configurations across all actions"
    - "Quality dashboard infrastructure deployed"
    - "AI review acceptance rate improved to 70% (target achieved)"

  weaknesses:
    - "Zero external adoption (Phase 3 but no adopters)"
    - "Insufficient sample size for AI review metrics (10 vs 20 target)"
    - "Zero coverage in two scripts (generate_review_quality_dashboard.py, test_data_collection.py)"
    - "Low coverage in env_config.py (47.83%)"
    - "No statistical significance in quality metrics yet"
