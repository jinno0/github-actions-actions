recent_achievements:
  - "PR-004: Complete integration test coverage (100%)"
  - "PR-005: Document integration test coverage definition"
  - "Structural test coverage maintained at 94.49%"
  - "All 13 Actions have integration tests"

known_limitations:
  - "Testing: No runtime validation (act tool not yet implemented)"
  - "Field-level integration coverage not tracked"
  - "Production adoption metrics unknown"
  - "Actual acceptance rate values not published"

strengths:
  - "✅ Excellent structural test coverage (94.49%, target 80%)"
  - "✅ 100% integration test coverage achieved (target 50%)"
  - "✅ Comprehensive documentation (README, instructions, examples)"
  - "✅ Quality metrics tracking (telemetry, acceptance rate)"
  - "✅ Clear testing roadmap and phase-based development"
  - "✅ All quality attributes (QA-001 to QA-004) met"
  - "✅ Privacy-focused telemetry with opt-out"

weaknesses:
  - "Gap between structural/integration testing and runtime behavior"
  - "No actual GitHub Actions execution testing"
  - "Unknown real-world usage and adoption"
  - "Acceptance rate tracking exists but values not visible"
