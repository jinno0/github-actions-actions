# === Gap Analysis ===

identified_gaps:
  - id: "GAP-001"
    severity: "medium"
    category: "testing"
    title: "Actual test coverage unknown"
    current_state:
      value: "Unknown"
      source: "C-011"
    desired_state:
      value: ">= 70%"
      source: "QA-001, ASM-002"
    gap_description: |
      pytest.ini specifies 70% coverage requirement, but actual coverage
      percentage has not been measured. Without knowing current coverage,
      we cannot determine if quality standards are being met.
    impact: "Cannot verify quality standards compliance"
    evidence:
      - "pytest.ini:22 specifies --cov-fail-under=70"
      - "coverage.json exists but not analyzed"

  - id: "GAP-002"
    severity: "high"
    category: "quality_metrics"
    title: "AI review acceptance rate unknown"
    current_state:
      value: "Unknown"
      source: "C-013"
    desired_state:
      value: ">= 70%"
      source: "QA-002, ASM-003"
    gap_description: |
      README.md states >= 70% acceptance rate goal, but current actual rate
      is unknown. The calculation script exists but has not been executed
      to establish a baseline.
    impact: "Cannot measure AI review quality effectiveness"
    evidence:
      - "scripts/calculate_acceptance_rate.py exists"
      - "README.md:127 mentions 70% target"

  - id: "GAP-003"
    severity: "low"
    category: "documentation"
    title: "Missing instructions for some actions"
    current_state:
      value: "3 actions lack instructions"
      source: "as_is.yml analysis"
    desired_state:
      value: "All actions have instructions"
      source: "QC-002 constraint"
    gap_description: |
      While all actions have examples, auto-merge, publish-pr, bulk-merge-prs,
      and bulk-rebase-prs lack dedicated instruction files in instructions/ directory.
    impact: "Reduced usability for complex automation actions"
    affected_actions:
      - auto-merge
      - publish-pr
      - bulk-merge-prs
      - bulk-rebase-prs

  - id: "GAP-004"
    severity: "medium"
    category: "adoption"
    title: "Organizational adoption status unknown"
    current_state:
      value: "Unknown"
      source: "C-012"
    desired_state:
      value: "Multiple projects using actions"
      source: "PURPOSE.md:70"
    gap_description: |
      PURPOSE.md Phase 3 includes "組織内プロジェクトへの導入とフィードバック収集"
      but no data exists on which projects have adopted these actions.
    impact: "Cannot measure success condition: '組織内の複数のリポジトリで採用される'"
    evidence:
      - "PURPOSE.md:25 marked as incomplete"

  - id: "GAP-005"
    severity: "low"
    category: "verification"
    title: "Dry-run validation implementation not verified"
    current_state:
      value: "Claimed but not verified"
      source: "C-009"
    desired_state:
      value: "All actions have dry-run tests"
      source: "CF-008, README.md:94"
    gap_description: |
      README.md claims "全ての AI Actions は Dry Run モードで自動検証されます"
      but actual implementation of dry-run tests has not been verified.
    impact: "Cannot verify if dry-run validation is working as claimed"
    confidence: "medium"

priority_ordering:
  - priority: 1
    gap_id: "GAP-002"
    reason: "High severity, direct impact on core value proposition (AI review quality)"
  - priority: 2
    gap_id: "GAP-001"
    reason: "Medium severity, blocks understanding of test quality"
  - priority: 3
    gap_id: "GAP-004"
    reason: "Medium severity, needed to measure Phase 3 completion"
  - priority: 4
    gap_id: "GAP-003"
    reason: "Low severity, usability improvement"
  - priority: 5
    gap_id: "GAP-005"
