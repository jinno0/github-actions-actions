# PR-007: Update README.md Adoption Claim to Reflect Reality

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **PR ID** | PR-007 |
| **Title** | Update README.md Adoption Claim to Reflect Reality |
| **Target Gap** | GAP-002 (partial mitigation) |
| **Priority** | HIGH (documentation accuracy) |
| **Effort** | 15 minutes |
| **Executable** | Yes (autonomous) |
| **Dependencies** | None |

## Problem Statement

**Current Issue:**
- README.md line 195 states: "Current adopters: (2 pilot projects)"
- ADOPTION.md contains only placeholder repositories (example/repo-1, example/repo-2)
- This creates a false impression of adoption and misleads readers

**Evidence:**
- `README.md:195`: "Current adopters: [See ADOPTION.md](ADOPTION.md) (2 pilot projects)"
- `ADOPTION.md:19-20`: Lists example/repo-1 and example/repo-2 as pilot projects
- Executor feedback (2026-02-07T11:06:34Z): Confirmed these are placeholders

**Impact:**
- Documentation credibility is compromised
- New users are misled about adoption status
- Violates transparency principle

## Proposed Solution

Change the README.md adoption claim from:
```markdown
Current adopters: [See ADOPTION.md](ADOPTION.md) (2 pilot projects)
```

To one of the following options:

**Option A (Recommended):** Honest and clear
```markdown
Current adopters: Seeking pilot projects
```

**Option B:** Informative
```markdown
Current adopters: [See ADOPTION.md](ADOPTION.md) for examples
```

**Option C:** Explicit about zero real adopters
```markdown
Current adopters: 0 (Seeking pilot projects - see [ADOPTION_GUIDE.md](ADOPTION_GUIDE.md))
```

**Recommendation:** Option A provides the clearest communication while maintaining professionalism.

## Files to Modify

1. **README.md** (line 195)
   - Change adoption claim text
   - No other modifications needed

## Verification Steps

1. Modify README.md line 195
2. Verify the change is grammatically correct
3. Verify the link still works if present
4. Confirm no other adoption claims need updating

## Expected Outcome

- README.md accurately reflects the current adoption status
- No false claims about pilot projects
- Maintains transparency with users
- Does not block ISS-NEW-002 resolution (can be reverted if real pilots are added)

## Rollback Plan

If actual pilot projects are identified:
1. Revert README.md to claim actual number
2. Update ADOPTION.md with real repositories
3. Update claim to: "Current adopters: [See ADOPTION.md](ADOPTION.md) (N pilot projects)"

## Success Criteria

- [ ] README.md no longer claims "2 pilot projects"
- [ ] New text accurately represents current state (zero real adopters)
- [ ] Documentation is consistent with ADOPTION.md
- [ ] No misleading claims remain

## Notes

- **This PR does NOT resolve GAP-002** (which requires actual pilot projects)
- **This PR DOES improve documentation accuracy** while waiting for ISS-NEW-002 resolution
- Change is low-risk and reversible
- Aligns with transparency principle in open source development

## Related Issues

- **Primary Blocker**: ISS-NEW-002 (Pilot project identification required)
- **Related Gaps**: GAP-002 (Adoption feedback collection)
- **Execution Feedback**: 2026-02-07T11:06:34Z identified this as recommended action

## Implementation

```bash
# Single line change in README.md
sed -i 's/Current adopters: \[See ADOPTION.md\](ADOPTION.md) (2 pilot projects)/Current adopters: Seeking pilot projects/' README.md
```

Or manual edit:
- Open README.md
- Find line 195
- Replace text with "Current adopters: Seeking pilot projects"
- Save and commit
