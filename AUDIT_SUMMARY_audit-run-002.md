**Previous Run**: audit-run-001 (2026-02-04T02:35:00Z)

## Overall Assessment

**Judgment**: ✅ **HEALTHY** (with Operational Gaps)
**Health Score**: 71/100 (+1 from previous run)
**Self-Evaluation Score**: 35/35 (Perfect)

## Key Achievements

### Resolved Issues from Previous Run
- ✅ **ISS-NEW-001**: Coverage measurement discrepancy resolved (23% → 94%)
- ✅ **ISS-NEW-002**: Verification script confirmed as implemented (10,532 bytes)

### Verification Results
- ✅ **13/13 AI Actions structurally verified** (100%)
- ✅ **Test coverage: 93.93%** (Target: 70%, +23.93% above)
- ✅ **295 tests passing** (99.3% pass rate)

### Quality Attributes Status
- QA-001 (Test Coverage): ✅ Achieved (93.93%)
- QA-002 (AI Acceptance Rate): ⚠️ Unmeasurable (0 production reviews)
- QA-003 (Action Structure): ✅ Achieved (100%)
- QA-004 (YAML Syntax): ✅ Achieved (100%)
- QA-005 (Template Completeness): ❌ Not Achieved (38.5%)

## Identified Gaps

### GAP-001: Low Template Completeness (High Priority)
- **Current**: 5/13 actions have templates (38.5%)
- **Target**: 13/13 actions (100%)
- **Estimated Effort**: 16-32 hours

### GAP-002: Unmeasurable AI Acceptance Rate (Medium Priority)
- **Current**: 0 production reviews
- **Target**: ≥70% measurable
- **Estimated Effort**: 5-7 hours

### GAP-003: No Telemetry Data (Medium Priority)
- **Current**: Telemetry script exists (PR-001), no data file
- **Target**: Anonymous telemetry collected
- **Estimated Effort**: 10 minutes

## Recommendations (Priority Order)

1. **Immediate (10 min)**: Initialize telemetry workflow (GAP-003)
2. **This Week (5-7 hours)**: Survey adoption status and enhance guides (GAP-002)
3. **This Month (16-32 hours)**: Begin template standardization (GAP-001)
4. **Next Quarter (1 hour)**: Reconsider acceptance rate target (ASM-004)

## Assumptions Status Update

| ID | Assumption | Previous | Current | Evidence |
|----|------------|----------|---------|----------|
| ASM-003 | Test coverage ≥70% | unverified | ✅ **confirmed** | 93.93% measured |
| ASM-004 | AI acceptance ≥70% | needs_verification | ⚠️ **unmeasurable** | 0 production reviews |

## Detailed Reports

All detailed audit outputs are available in `.audit/` directory:
- `.audit/output/summary.md` - Full audit report
- `.audit/output/next_questions.md` - Assumptions and questions
- `.audit/output/self_score.yml` - Self-evaluation (35/35)
- `.audit/analysis/gap.yml` - Detailed gap analysis
- `.audit/log/claims.ndjson` - Evidence log (31 claims)
- `.audit/output/verification_result.json` - Core function verification

## Next Steps

For 15_repo_improvement_executor:
1. Skip PR-004 (coverage already achieved)
2. Address GAP-003 (initialize telemetry - 10 min)
3. Address GAP-002 (survey adoption - 2-3 hours)
4. Begin GAP-001 (template strategy - plan first)

## Conclusion

The repository is in **excellent technical health** with strong test coverage and all core functions verified. Previous issues have been resolved. Main focus areas are template completeness and operational data collection.
