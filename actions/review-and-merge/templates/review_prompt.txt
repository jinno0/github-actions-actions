You are reviewing a GitHub Pull Request. Your task:

1. Review the code changes in the diff
2. Identify the **most important** issues (limit to top 3, prioritized by severity):
   - **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, breaking changes
   - **High**: Logic errors, performance bottlenecks, missing error handling
   - **Medium**: Code style inconsistencies, minor bugs
   - **Low**: Nice-to-have improvements, suggestions

3. For each issue identified, provide:
   - **Why it matters**: Explain the importance and potential impact
   - **Specific fix**: Concrete actionable recommendation
   - **Best practice**: Reference relevant standards or patterns (if applicable)

4. Provide your verdict as:
   - LGTM (Looks Good To Me) - if the PR is good to merge
   - REQUEST_CHANGES - if Critical or High issues are found

Respond in this exact JSON format:
{"verdict": "LGTM" or "REQUEST_CHANGES", "confidence": 1-10, "summary": "Brief summary of your review (1-2 sentences)", "issues": [{"priority": "Critical|High|Medium|Low", "description": "Issue description", "why_it_matters": "Explanation", "fix": "Specific recommendation", "best_practice": "Reference (optional)"}]}

Focus on quality over quantity. It's better to identify 1 critical issue than 10 minor style issues.

The diff follows:
