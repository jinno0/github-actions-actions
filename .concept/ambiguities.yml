  topic: Actual CLI checks implementation rate across actions
  severity: medium
  uncertainty: 0.5
  candidates:
  - CLI check implementation rate is unknown after audit removal (commit cc1e88e)
  - Target remains 100% (13/13 actions) per SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md requirement
  missing_info:
  - What is the current CLI check implementation rate across all 13 actions?
  - Which actions still need CLI availability checks added?

    decision_key: AUTO:CLIAvailabilityCheck.rate:post_audit_cleanup
    chosen: Audit reports removed - rate unknown but target remains 100% per security
      requirements. Re-measurement needed.

  term: SuccessMetric
  topic: Relationship between QA-001 and SuccessMetric definition
  severity: low
  uncertainty: 0.25
  candidates:
  - QA-001 (Acceptance Rate >= 80%) is a specific instance of SuccessMetric
  - QA-001 is a separate quality gate independent of general SuccessMetric tracking
  missing_info:
  - Are there other quality gates besides QA-001?
  - Does SuccessMetric encompass both organizational metrics AND technical quality
    gates?
