      Remaining 6 actions don't use Claude and don't need checks. Ambiguity resolved.

  topic: Relationship between QA-001 and SuccessMetric definition
  severity: low
  uncertainty: 0.25
  candidates:
  - QA-001 (Acceptance Rate >= 80%) is a specific instance of SuccessMetric
  - QA-001 is a separate quality gate independent of general SuccessMetric tracking
  missing_info:
  - Are there other quality gates besides QA-001?
  - Does SuccessMetric encompass both organizational metrics AND technical quality
    gates?
