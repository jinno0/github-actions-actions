    proposed_canonical: ScriptExtraction
    proposed_layer: aux
    term_raw_examples:
      - script extraction
      - extract bash scripts
      - extracted scripts
    reason: Refactoring practice of extracting bash scripts from action.yml into scripts/ directory
    evidence:
      - source: actions/review-and-merge/scripts/review-and-fix.sh#L1-L4
        quote: Bash scripts can be extracted from action.yml into separate executable files in scripts/ directory
      - source: commit b2f8f31
        quote: Extracting bash scripts from action.yml improves readability (181 to 82 lines), enables independent testing
    auto_merge_candidates:
      - term: TemplateFile
        similarity: 0.45
        rationale: Both relate to code organization, but TemplateFile is about prompts while ScriptExtraction is about logic separation
      - term: CompositeAction
        similarity: 0.52
        rationale: ScriptExtraction is a practice within CompositeAction development, not a distinct architectural concept

    auto_decision:
      id: AUTO-005
      decision: Accept ScriptExtraction as aux term
      rationale: |
        1. Evidence strength: 2 sources (actual script file + commit message with clear rationale)
        2. Low merge similarity: Highest candidate (CompositeAction) is 0.52 < 0.78 threshold
        3. Semantic distinctness: ScriptExtraction is a refactoring practice, distinct from:
           - TemplateFile (prompt text management)
           - CompositeAction (architectural construct)
        4. Auxiliary layer: Appropriate for refactoring best practices
