    reason: "BMAD workflow concepts appear in execution summary but infrastructure is incomplete; these are system-external process concepts, not core to github-actions-actions product"
    evidence:
      - source: "workflow-execution-summary.md#L4-L5"
        quote: "Workflow: /bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow:2-implementation-test-flow"
      - source: "workflow-execution-summary.md#L17-L22"
        quote: "The workflow file at .claude/commands/bmad/bmm/workflows/full-bmad-project-flow/2-implementation-test-flow.md is incomplete"

    rationale: "BMAD workflow concepts are process-related (how work is done), not product-domain concepts. These belong to BMAD framework documentation, not github-actions-actions ontology."
