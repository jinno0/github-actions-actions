    reason: Testing mechanism for validating actions without actual execution. Accepted
      with 2 evidence sources and clear boundaries.

    proposed_canonical: CIWorkflow
    proposed_layer: aux
    reason: CI workflow is essentially a CompositeAction for testing purposes. Merged
      to avoid term proliferation.
    term_raw_examples:
      - CI workflow
      - CI testing
      - automated testing
  - id: TP-003
    proposed_canonical: TestSuite
    proposed_layer: aux
    term_raw_examples:
      - test suite
      - comprehensive test script
      - validation script
    reason: Test scripts validate action structure, templates, examples, and instructions.
      However, this is an implementation detail of DryRun validation, not a core
      concept. MERGED into DryRun to avoid term proliferation (bloat control).
