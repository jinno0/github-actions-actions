# Resolution Summary
status: superseded
decision_key: AUTO:SecurityVulnerability.testing_gap:structural_vs_behavioral
chosen: "Tests are structural (pattern-based) and may pass despite vulnerabilities. Gap exists between test claims and actual security posture. CRITICAL vulnerabilities have been fixed in commits 9dd956a and 953bc9f."
policy: safety_first + transparency
confidence_auto: 0.95
decided_at_run: "2026-01-29T22:15:00Z"
superseded_at_run: 20
resolution_note: "CRITICAL security vulnerabilities have been addressed. Actions now use base64 encoding, awk for safe substitution, and path validation. Testing gap remains (structural vs behavioral) but vulnerability posture is improved."
